"def" form is "by-name" - its right hand side is evaluated on each use

"val" form is "by-value" - it is evaluated at the point of the definition itsself

val x = 2
val y = square(x) //y refers to 4 not to square(2)

def loop: Boolean = loop

def x = loop //is ok when you define it
val x = loop //it is not ok when you define it, it is trying to evaluate right away

If a function1 is called only by other function2, then define the function1 inside of function2 (don't poluate the space!)
